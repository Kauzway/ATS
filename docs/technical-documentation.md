## Technical Indicators

ATS implements several technical indicators for stock analysis:

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

- **Implementation**: `calculateRSI()` in `src/utils/indicators.ts`
- **Parameters**:
  - `data`: Array of stock data
  - `period`: RSI period (default: 14)
- **Interpretation**:
  - RSI > 70: Potentially overbought
  - RSI < 30: Potentially oversold
  - RSI > 50: Bullish momentum
  - RSI < 50: Bearish momentum

### ADX (Average Directional Index)

ADX measures the strength of a trend, regardless of its direction. It's often used with the Directional Movement Indicators (+DI and -DI) to determine trend direction.

- **Implementation**: `calculateADX()` in `src/utils/indicators.ts`
- **Parameters**:
  - `data`: Array of stock data
  - `period`: ADX period (default: 14)
- **Interpretation**:
  - ADX < 20: Weak trend
  - ADX 20-30: Moderate trend
  - ADX 30-50: Strong trend
  - ADX > 50: Very strong trend
  - +DI > -DI: Bullish trend
  - -DI > +DI: Bearish trend

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price.

- **Implementation**: `calculateMACD()` in `src/utils/indicators.ts`
- **Parameters**:
  - `data`: Array of stock data
  - `fastPeriod`: Fast EMA period (default: 12)
  - `slowPeriod`: Slow EMA period (default: 26)
  - `signalPeriod`: Signal EMA period (default: 9)
- **Interpretation**:
  - MACD > Signal: Bullish
  - MACD < Signal: Bearish
  - MACD crossing above Signal: Buy signal
  - MACD crossing below Signal: Sell signal
  - Histogram increasing: Increasing momentum
  - Histogram decreasing: Decreasing momentum

### Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band (simple moving average) with an upper and lower band that are standard deviations away from the middle band.

- **Implementation**: `calculateBollingerBands()` in `src/utils/enhancedIndicators.ts`
- **Parameters**:
  - `data`: Array of stock data
  - `period`: Period for SMA (default: 20)
  - `multiplier`: Standard deviation multiplier (default: 2)
- **Interpretation**:
  - Price > Upper Band: Potentially overbought
  - Price < Lower Band: Potentially oversold
  - Price moving from Lower to Middle Band: Bullish momentum
  - Price moving from Upper to Middle Band: Bearish momentum
  - Bandwidth expanding: Increasing volatility
  - Bandwidth contracting: Decreasing volatility

### Stochastic Oscillator

Stochastic Oscillator is a momentum indicator that compares a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time.

- **Implementation**: `calculateStochastic()` in `src/utils/enhancedIndicators.ts`
- **Parameters**:
  - `data`: Array of stock data
  - `kPeriod`: Period for %K (default: 14)
  - `dPeriod`: Period for %D (default: 3)
- **Interpretation**:
  - %K > 80: Potentially overbought
  - %K < 20: Potentially oversold
  - %K crossing above %D: Buy signal
  - %K crossing below %D: Sell signal

### Ichimoku Cloud

Ichimoku Cloud is a collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels, momentum, and trend direction.

- **Implementation**: `calculateIchimokuCloud()` in `src/utils/enhancedIndicators.ts`
- **Components**:
  - Tenkan-sen (Conversion Line): (9-period high + 9-period low) / 2
  - Kijun-sen (Base Line): (26-period high + 26-period low) / 2
  - Senkou Span A (Leading Span A): (Tenkan-sen + Kijun-sen) / 2
  - Senkou Span B (Leading Span B): (52-period high + 52-period low) / 2
  - Chikou Span (Lagging Span): Close price plotted 26 periods behind
- **Interpretation**:
  - Price above the cloud: Bullish
  - Price below the cloud: Bearish
  - Tenkan-sen crossing above Kijun-sen: Buy signal
  - Tenkan-sen crossing below Kijun-sen: Sell signal
  - Cloud thickness: Trend strength

## State Management

ATS uses Redux Toolkit for state management with the following slices:

### App Slice (`appSlice.ts`)

Manages application-wide state such as initialization status and available indices.

### Theme Slice (`themeSlice.ts`)

Manages the application theme (light/dark mode) and persists the preference in local storage.

### Market Slice (`marketSlice.ts`)

Manages market data including index data, sector performance, and top-performing stocks.

### Stock Slice (`stockSlice.ts`)

Manages individual stock data, details, and technical indicators.

## API Integration

ATS uses Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) for API integration with the following API slices:

### Market API Slice (`marketApiSlice.ts`)

Endpoints for fetching market data, sector performance, and top-performing stocks.

### Stock API Slice (`stockApiSlice.ts`)

Endpoints for fetching stock data, details, and technical indicators.

## Chart Components

ATS implements various chart components using the Lightweight Charts library:

### CandlestickChart

Displays price data in candlestick format with optional volume histogram.

### RSIChart

Displays the Relative Strength Index with overbought/oversold levels and divergence detection.

### ADXChart

Displays the Average Directional Index with trend strength and direction indicators.

### BollingerBandsChart

Displays price data with Bollinger Bands overlay for volatility and trend analysis.

## Machine Learning Integration

ATS includes machine learning predictions for price forecasting using TensorFlow.js. The predictions include:

- Next day price prediction
- Next week price prediction
- Trend prediction (bullish, bearish, neutral)
- Probability of prediction accuracy

The ML model analyzes historical price patterns, volume, technical indicators, and market sentiment to generate predictions.

## Responsive Design

ATS is designed to be responsive across various device sizes:

- Desktop: Full layout with sidebar, header, and content
- Tablet: Collapsed sidebar with toggle button, adaptable grid layouts
- Mobile: Stacked layouts, hidden sidebar with toggle button, optimized navigation

## Performance Optimization

- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading of page components to reduce initial bundle size
- **Memoization**: React.memo for complex components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Virtualization**: For long lists of stocks to improve rendering performance
- **Efficient Redux Selectors**: For optimized state access
- **Web Workers**: For heavy calculations (in progress)

## Error Handling

ATS implements comprehensive error handling:

- **API Error Handling**: Catch and display user-friendly error messages
- **Fallback UI**: For when components fail to load
- **Error Boundaries**: To isolate errors to specific components
- **Retry Logic**: For transient API failures

## Security

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information stored in environment variables
- **Input Validation**: For all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **HTTPS**: Enforced for all API communications
- **Content Security Policy**: To prevent XSS attacks
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication (planned)

## Deployment

ATS is designed to be deployed on Google Cloud Run:

1. Build the Docker image
2. Push to Google Container Registry
3. Deploy to Google Cloud Run

Detailed deployment instructions are provided in the "Deployment Guide" document.

## Future Development

- **Real-time Data**: Integration with websocket for real-time price updates
- **User Authentication**: User accounts with personalized watchlists and alerts
- **Advanced ML Models**: More sophisticated prediction models with higher accuracy
- **Backtesting System**: For testing trading strategies on historical data
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications for iOS and Android

## Conclusion

ATS provides a comprehensive platform for technical analysis of stocks with advanced indicators, machine learning predictions, and a responsive user interface. This document outlines the technical details of the project to facilitate understanding and further development.
